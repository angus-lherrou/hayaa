# Hayaa 0.2.0

`hayaa` is a terminal implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

The name "Hayaa" comes from the Arabic word الحياة *al-Ḥayaa*, meaning "life".

## Notes
* This isn't *truly* Conway's game, as there are edges to the board (your terminal's borders). Also, things seem to be a bit broken at the moment with larger automata. The basic glider works great, though.
* Note that the console input seems to miss quite a few keystrokes. I'm not sure why yet.
* I wrote this to try out Nim. It is by no means idiomatic Nim.
